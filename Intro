Atlanta and New York: two of the biggest hubs in the United States of America. Thousands of companies operate out of both of these cities, 
and millions of employees make their lives here. They are also home to some of the world's best colleges, such as New York University, Columbia University, 
Cornell University, Georgia Institute of Technology, and Emory University. Personally, if I get off the Cornell waitlist, I will have a very difficult 
decision to make between Georgia Tech and Cornell. Similarly, thousands of people have a tough time deciding between the fantastic college and jop options in these 
two specific cities. And at the end of the day, the final decision may come down to personal fit regarding the location, Atlanta or New York. 
Hence, my program aims to find specific differences between Atlanta and New York to help thousands, including myself, make a crucial decision about their next 
step in life.
